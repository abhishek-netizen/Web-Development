//Immutability:-
// Once we created an object we connot change or mutate it
//Strings are immutable in js


//Bottomline is if you are building application with redux you should not mutate Data
//thats a fundamental thing in Redux

let book = {}
book.title = "sea"; //not acceptable in redux
