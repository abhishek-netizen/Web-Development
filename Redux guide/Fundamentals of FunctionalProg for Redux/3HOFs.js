//Higher Order Functions
//HOF are functions that takes function as argument or returns it or both

//Ex of HOF's
//Ex1.
// let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// let mulNum = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
// console.log(mulNum); //[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]

//Ex2.
setInterval(() => console.log("Hello"), 5000); //keep on printing after every 5 sec
//setTimeout // which tells time out for that function after 5 seconds
